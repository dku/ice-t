	   The CCNx Name segment types are:

   o  Name Segment: A generic name segment that includes arbitrary
      octets.

   o  Application Type N: An application may use application-specific
      parameters, numbered as integers, where N is from 0 to a system-
      specific maximum, not less than 255.  These are represented as
      "App:1=value", for example.

What about T_IPIP?
